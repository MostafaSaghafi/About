# About

I am Mostafa, the manager and founding member of the independent international DaneshjooYar group. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have developed a strong enthusiasm for tackling the challenges in multidisciplinary disciplines. My experience has included navigating challenges that have influenced my approach to solutions. I really think that critical thinking is necessary to break apart difficult problems into doable parts. Using energy and tenacity as my compass, I have overcome several obstacles that have presented themselves.Besides, I understand how crucial good communication is to reaching team goals. Strong relationships encourage cooperation and creativity—qualities that are critical for any group's success. I am dedicated to using these principles at DaneshjooYar as we work to have a significant impact in our different fields.

# My background and history

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Gonabad University, where I developed a comprehensive comprehension of the fundamental principles of civil engineering. This fundamental experience served as the foundation for my master's degree at Shahrood University of Technology, during which I furthered my understanding of hydraulic structures and water engineering. During my master's studies, I had the opportunity to work on research with distinguished professors Ahmad Ahmadi and Behnaz Bigdeli. My thesis, **"Surface Water Body Detection and Flood Monitoring Using Fusion of Multiple Remote Sensing Data"**, examined novel methods for monitoring water bodies and assessing flood risks. The primary concept of my research emphasized the advantages of fusion multispectral sensors and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to monitor flood events and detect surface water. We used a comprehensive approach that included data fusion, time series analysis, supervised machine learning techniques, and decision making to improve the accuracy and usefulness of systems meant to detect surface water and monitor floods. This work not only enhanced the academic community's knowledge but also underscored the critical role that advanced technologies play in addressing water management challenges. I remain committed to leveraging my academic background and research experience to contribute to the advancement of environmental disaster and civil engineering as I progress in my professional life.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
